Case Study
================

## Get the data

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)

data(nyc_airbnb)

nyc_airbnb = 
  nyc_airbnb |>
  rename(borough = neighbourhood_group)|>
  mutate(stars = review_scores_location/2)
```

### Brainstorm questions

- Where are AirBNBs expensive?
  - Borough? Neighborhood?
  - Do other factors (room type) affect price? What about rating?
- How long are AirBNBs active?
  - Are AirBNBs illegal and do they get shut down?
- Which units have the most availability?
- How is review score impacted by location?
- How many apts are run by one host?
  - Does that affect price?
  - Does that vary by neighborhood?
- Where are AirBNBs?
  - Borough? Neighborhood?
  - Lat and long?
